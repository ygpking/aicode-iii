features:
  - title: AI Agent
    details: Supports OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini compatible protocols, with multiple vendors switchable anytime. Built-in tools cover file read/write, shell execution, background terminal, web search and image recognition, with streaming output and automatic context compression for long conversations.
  - title: Built-in Terminal & Linux Container
    details: A local container built on Termux components and PRoot, shipping with an Alpine image. Import custom rootfs, mount host directories, and keep terminals running in the background.
  - title: Remote SSH Mode
    details: Use a remote server as the execution backend — commands over the exec channel, files over SFTP, terminals over the shell channel. Operate remote projects directly from your phone.
  - title: Checkpoints & Undo
    details: File snapshots are recorded automatically before the AI modifies code, so you can roll back with one tap in the conversation — restore code only, conversation only, or both.
  - title: MCP, Skills & Memory
    details: Connect local stdio and remote HTTP MCP servers to dynamically extend tools. Global and project-level skills plus long-term memory let the AI reuse experience across sessions.
  - title: Git & Workspace Sync
    details: Built-in status, branch, commit, diff and tag management. SFTP / FTP sync support, plus a built-in FTP server for managing files from your computer.
